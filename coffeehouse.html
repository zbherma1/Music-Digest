            <br>
            <p>The first edition of this year's bi-annual Coffee House event was held on Sunday, October 23, in<br>
                the lobby of Johnson Hall.</p>
            <p>According to those who were there it was cool to see some of the students' hidden talents, and<br>
                the night was full of memorable performances, including Lanz Powell's rap which was by far the<br>
                headline of the proceedings according to the attendees.</p>
            <p>“Lanz's rap was super unique and very awesome to watch. He poured his heart and soul into it<br>
                and he definitely did an amazing job,” said TIU freshman Liam Mickle.</p>
            <p>Coffee House is an event that allows students to show off some of their talents and attempt to<br>
                make people laugh, although sometimes the actual existence of laughter can be hit or miss.</p>
            <p>Coffee House is also a time when Johnson Hall RA's create fellowship with the students, which<br>
                is a wonderful thing to have in the small, intimate community of TIU.</p>
            <p>"It's a great time for us RAs to get to meet more students while also creating a great experience<br>
                for those who attend," said Isaac Foote.</p>
            <p>Over the years the event has evolved from a smaller event to where we see it now, as a lot of<br>
                students performed and even more were in attendance, with roughly 100 people there watching<br>
                the acts.</p>
            <p>The event was packed with people in a very small venue. They had desserts and drinks in one of<br>
                the corners. It was also fairly dark.</p>
            <p>Overall it seems like the students liked the way it was set up and are looking forward to next<br>
                semester's Coffee House.</p>
            <p>"I liked the desserts being there along with drinks, plus really nice seating from where I was. The<br>
                stage set up was very cool. I would go again next year," said Mickle.</p>
            <p>It will be interesting to see if any changes are made for the spring semester's event, but the night<br>
                was certainly a success. Keep an eye out for much more laughter, fun, and community when the<br>
                second one rolls around.</p>
