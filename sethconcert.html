            <br>
            <p>What makes a concert a concert? Is it the number of people there, all listening to your every<br>
                note? Or is it the level of engagement from the audience?</p>
            <p>That is the question that Christian artist Seth Jernigan faced at his concert last Tuesday at 7 p.m.<br>
                as people slowly trickled into the A.T.O. Chapel.</p>
            <p>By the time the concert started 15 minutes later, there were only 20 people in attendance.</p>
            <p>But Jernigan didn't let the amount of people, or the lack thereof, deter him.</p>
            <p>“This is gonna be super intimate, gonna be super interactive, and I would love for it to be that<br>
                way,” Jernigan said.</p>
            <p>Jernigan started the concert with a short summary of who he was (a native of Pittsburgh, Penn.),<br>
                what he was doing there (touring to promote his new album, God in the Waiting), and how he<br>
                was feeling (super excited to share the album).</p>
            <p>And then he immediately went off script, asking the audience if there was a song that they would<br>
                like to sing to start off the night, and an audience member suggested “The Stand” by Hillsong.</p>
            <p>After kicking off the night in corporate worship, Jernigan began to play his original songs,<br>
                opening with “More of You.”</p>
            <p>The night was filled with songs with a multitude of sources of inspiration, like “Psalm 27,”<br>
                which is based on Psalms 27 and the Presbyterian tradition of singing Psalms a capella.</p>
            <p>Dean Whitcher, his pianist, would occasionally contribute vocally, whether to sing himself, like<br>
                he did in “Lord Please Stay,” or to add back-up vocals like in “Resurrection Life.”</p>
            <p>As Jernigan explained the story behind each of his songs, he gave credit to everyone who had<br>
                helped him with in the production of his album, such as Whitcher, who created the piano and<br>
                bass tracks, and Emily Rodgers down in Nashville who recorded the cello used in “Make Me a<br>
                Child,” to name just a few.</p>
            <p>Jernigan ended his concert with the song that inspired the title of his album, “God in the<br>
                Waiting.”</p>
            <p>After the concert ended, many decided to hang around, talking and connecting with each other.</p>
            <p>“I stumbled across Seth's music back in July, and he had posted videos of himself just singing<br>
                along to the Psalms.” Student Government President Stephen Largent said. “I thought that he<br>
                was really talented, and being student body president, I was like…we haven't had a concert here<br>
                in a long time, and so I reached out.”</p>
            <p>“It was great!” Lillian Smith said. “I thought they were very talented singers and did a great job.<br>
                Beautiful music. I really liked how they used actual Psalms for the lyrics. I hope that they are<br>
                able to come back again to a full house. Someday. They deserved a bigger crowd.”</p>
            <p>“I thought it would be a cool experience, since I've never been to a worship concert before,”<br>
                Jalyn Leicht said. “They are really talented singers, and I love how they are really supportive of<br>
                each other, like one would be smiling while the other was performing. I really enjoyed it! I hope<br>
                we can see them again, because it was really fun!”</p>
            <p>“It was very intimate, very togetherness,” Jernigan said. “It just felt really good. It felt like<br>
                everyone was worshiping, like everyone was engaged, and when that happens, I'm more<br>
                engaged.”</p>
            <p>So to answer the opening question: it is engagement that determines a concert, not the number of<br>
                people that attend.</p>
            <p>“This concert was a reminder that God is faithful no matter what,” Seth Rieske said. “That no<br>
                matter what dark times you're in, no matter what you're going through, God is there. God is with<br>
                you. And even in the waiting, God is there, at your side, no matter what.”</p>
