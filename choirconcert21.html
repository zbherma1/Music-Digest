            <h3 id="article-title">Trinity's Choir Has Its Spring Choir Concert In The ATO Chapel</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Trinity International University's choir sang "Songs and Prayers of Praise and Worship" at their<br>
                spring concert on April 29th at 7:30 PM in the ATO chapel.</p>
            <p>The concert has been in the making for the entire semester, and some choir members stated they<br>
                felt it would never come.</p>
            <p>"It was great to see the hard work that multiple of my classmates put in to make this concert a<br>
                success pay off," concert attendant Jakob Flores said. "[I] definitely was not expecting what I<br>
                saw, with this being my first time at something like this."</p>
            <p>The event ran for approximately two and a half hours. Choir member Mark Akert provided<br>
                insight into the practices and the amount of work this concert took to be a success.</p>
            <p>"It felt like we have been practicing for forever," Akert said, "Having to battle football and choir<br>
                all in one semester was extremely hard."</p>
            <p>He also said he appreciated the flexibility his coaches and directors allowed him to have with his<br>
                schedule.</p>
            <p>The turnout for the event was tremendous, with the chapel infused with people ready and eager<br>
                to hear some good music.</p>
            <p>"The nerves were most definitely there," Akert said. "Like before a football game [with]<br>
                everyone there to see you."</p>
            <p>The pressure on these students was amazing, but their performance was even more impressive,<br>
                causing many in the crowd to rise out of their seats for the performance.</p>
            <p>"I just want to thank everyone who attended, and all my choirmates," said star singer Arthur<br>
                Williams.</p>
            <p>The Trinity community could not be more proud of these students, especially with finals<br>
                approaching and many of the participants also involved in other events on campus.</p>
